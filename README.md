This project combines my passions for traveling and programming. The purpose of this project was to get myself familiar with the React.js framework that I would use for my summer internship abroad.
I love to travel and have so many places that I want to see and visit, so I decided to create an application that would track places I've been and want to go.
In the future, I would like to implement AI/machine learning so that I can add places to my wishlist and it will tell me which months are the best to visit.
